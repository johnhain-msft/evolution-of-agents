    "# Evolution of agents - MCP - Postgress\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open spec that standardizes how AI clients (agents, IDEs, chat apps) discover and call external tools and access resources. It uses a client–server model where servers expose capabilities (tools/functions, prompts, resources like files/DBs) over JSON-RPC transports (e.g., stdio, WebSocket). The goal is portability and safety: tools are reusable across different LLM runtimes with consistent schemas, auth, and streaming I/O, while remaining sandboxed. In practice, you run an MCP server for a service and any MCP-compatible client can list its capabilities and invoke them.\n",

    "**Description:**\n",
    "This notebook explores how agents can interact with external MCP servers to discover and invoke tools, prompts, and resources. It demonstrates the client-server architecture for tool orchestration, focusing on portability, safety, and cross-runtime compatibility."
